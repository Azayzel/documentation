## Overview

Cloud Security Management Agentless Vulnerability scanning helps you detect, prioritize, and manage [vulnerabilities][1] in your cloud accounts without needing to install the Datadog Agent.
Agentless Scanning is available for vulnerabilities detected across your container images and hosts. 

## What We Support
- Cloud Providers (AWS)
- Operating Systems ?
- Container Image Formats ?
- Language Libraries ?
- ... anything else?

## How it works

Datadog Agentless Vulnerability scanning does .. need more info here.

### AWS Integration

Within the AWS integration in Datadog, after selecting the Cloud Formation template, and enabling [Remote Configuration][4] for your organization, Datadog updates the template with the necessary IAM permissions, and deploys a modified, standalone version of the Datadog Agent on an EC2 instance in your AWS Cloud account. Datadog scans the EBS volume to generate a [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)][2], and sends the SBOM back to Datadog [Vulnerability Management][3], where you can investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. 

Scans occur every 12 hours.

**Note**: The actual data that is scanned remains within your infrastructure, and only the findings are reported back to Datadog.

The following diagram illustrates how Agentless Vulnerability scanning works when deployed within each Cloud account:

### Advanced deployment

Agentless Vulnerability scanning can also be deployed in a central cloud account, and utilities the manual Terraform installation. 

The following diagram illustrates how Agentless Vulnerability scanning works when deployed in a central cloud account:

## Security considerations

- Address security risks
  - List top three security risks

## Agentless Scanning with Existing Agent Coverage
- Explain exclusion of scans on Agent-based resources with VM enabled
The Agentless Scanner will scan all compute instances (e.g. EC2s, Lambdas, containers) that are not running the Datadog Agent AND have not been explicitly excluded from scanning by the customer.

**Diagram Coming March 1st**

## Cloud Service Provider Cost
- Make it clear that customers need to pay cloud providers to run Agentless Scanning
We plan to stay simple in our wording to avoid giving any concrete figures


## Next Steps (Links)
- Agentless Scanning Set Up
- AWS Setup
- Azure Private Beta
- Agentless Scanning Setup Reference

Give links to break down by cloud provider (AWS only at this time)
Direct customers to sign up form for Azure private beta

## Agentless Scanning Set Up
